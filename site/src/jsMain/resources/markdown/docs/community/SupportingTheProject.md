You should feel no obligation to pay anything to use Kobweb -- it is licensed liberally quite intentionally and
given to the community without any strings attached.

However, if you like what we are doing and are determined to support our efforts financially, we would gratefully accept
a donation at [ko-fi.com/bitspittle](https://ko-fi.com/bitspittle). Money will go towards development fees and rewarding
contributors.

Alternately, there are countless non-financial ways to support this project, such as:

* Just use Kobweb and spread the word!
* Consider tagging your website with a "Made with [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb)" blurb in the footer.
* Write articles about Kobweb / share your experience using it.
* Send us feedback, be it appreciative or critical. Please don't be shy about letting us know if there are things you
  feel are missing. If you have ideas that you think can make Kobweb better, please share them.
* Join our community on Discord and/or Slack and answer questions.
* Pick up a bug or feature to work on.

Ultimately, I want Kobweb to be known for having a kind, patient, and welcoming community. As long as you are helping
us accomplish that, then please consider yourself already supporting our efforts.
