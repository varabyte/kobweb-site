In this section, we'll cover foundational concepts that apply to the frontend part of your site.

In other words, these articles introduce concepts that, put together, enable you to organize code and resources in a way
that Kobweb can then process them and package them into HTML files and other data. These files can then be served from
the web hosting service of your choice.

Note that this documentation assumes some minimal familiarity with Compose
HTML. [Here is a good tutorial to review](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/tutorials/HTML/Building_UI)
in case you need a refresher. At the very least, you should know that Compose HTML provides composables that
correspond to HTML elements, like `Div { ... }` for a `<div>...</div>` element.
