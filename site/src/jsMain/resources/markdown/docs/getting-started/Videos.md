If you prefer to watch videos instead of (or in addition to) reading text, this section introduces a handful of
external resources that can also help you get started with Kobweb.

Otherwise, feel free to skip and proceed to the next section!

## Intro talk

You
can [check out my talk at Droidcon SF 24](https://www.droidcon.com/2024/07/17/kobwebcreating-websites-in-kotlin-leveraging-compose-html/)
for a high level overview of Kobweb. The talk showcases what Kobweb can do, introduces Compose HTML (which it builds
on top of), and covers a wide range of frontend and backend functionality. It is light on code but heavy on
understanding the structure and capabilities of the framework.

### Stevdza-san

One of Kobweb's users, Stevdza-San, has created free starting tutorials that demonstrate how to build projects using
Kobweb.

* [Getting started with Kobweb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5B-CxJTKlg)
    * This video introduces basic Kobweb concepts and walks you through the process from creating a simple
      (static layout) site to exporting it locally on your machine (with files you can then upload to a static hosting
      provider of your choice).
* [Deploying a Kobweb site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciAqQPThXn0)
    * This video builds upon the previous, showcasing some additional tips and tricks, and walks you all the way through
      to deploying your site live on the internet using free hosting.
* [Building a full stack multiplatform site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcrY0qayWF4)
    * This demonstrates how to write both frontend and backend logic. It also demonstrates how you can write a separate
      Android frontend that can also work with your server. (This video is still useful to watch even if you never
      intend to use Android).

> It's easy to start with a static layout site first and migrate to a full stack site later, in case you're feeling
