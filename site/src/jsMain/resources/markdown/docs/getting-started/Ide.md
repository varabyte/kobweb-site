## IntelliJ IDEA

While you can use any Kotlin-aware IDE to develop a Kobweb project, we strongly encourage using IntelliJ IDEA.

Our team will always have at least one person using the free IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to make sure that Kobweb
never accidentally becomes reliant on any paid-only features, but of course, if you have an Ultimate license, you can
use that.

If you're new to Kotlin development, we suggest installing the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/), as it is a program that
makes it easy to download, update, and otherwise manage your IntelliJ IDEA installations.

## Kobweb IntelliJ Plugin

This step is *optional*, but consider installing
the [Kobweb IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23883-kobweb). This plugin aims to provide
inspections, actions, settings, templates, and IDE integrations for Kobweb-specific concepts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the time of writing this note (in early 2025), the plugin is still relatively minimal, so please set
> expectations accordingly. Hopefully this will be remedied by the end of 2025.
>
> In case this note becomes stale, you
> can [review our changelog here](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-intellij-plugin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the most
> up-to-date list of current features.
>
> If you would like to help us accelerate the development of this plugin,
> consider [checking out the project](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-intellij-plugin) and let us know if you would
> be interested in contributing.
