## IntelliJ IDEA

While you can use any Kotlin-aware IDE to develop a Kobweb project, we strongly encourage using IntelliJ IDEA.

Our team will always have at least one person using the free Community Edition to make sure that Kobweb never
accidentally becomes reliant on any paid-only features, but of course, if you have an Ultimate license, you can use
that.

But if you're new to Kotlin development and aren't sure where to start, we officially recommend using IntelliJ IDEA
Community Edition.

We suggest you get it using the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/), as this approach makes
it easy to download, update, and otherwise manage your IntelliJ IDEA installations.

## Kobweb IntelliJ Plugin

This step is *optional*, but consider installing
the [Kobweb IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23883-kobweb). This plugin aims to provide
inspections, actions, settings, templates, and IDE integrations for Kobweb-specific concepts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the time of writing this note (in early 2025), the plugin is still relatively minimal, so please set
> expectations accordingly. Hopefully this will be remedied by the end of 2025. You
> can [review our changelog here](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-intellij-plugin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for
> the most up-to-date list of current features.
>
> If you would like to help us accelerate the development of this plugin,
> consider [checking out the project](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-intellij-plugin) and let us know if you would
> like to try contributing.
