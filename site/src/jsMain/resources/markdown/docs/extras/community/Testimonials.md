I'm pleased to mention that Kobweb has received feedback from some satisfied users. Here are a few:

> [!QUOTE]
> This is a pretty bloody amazing technology you've created here. I have been dreading upgrading my website for ages because I didn't want to go back to html and css 🫤 now I can stay with Kotlin 😀

> [!QUOTE]
> Kobweb looks fantastic and I've been trying to use Kotlin in all parts of my hobby stuff and work, so I got real excited when I saw Kobweb, even though I hadn't been satisfied with a web framework in a long time. Incredible work.

> [!QUOTE]
> I started using Kobweb last week and I have to say this [...] reinvented web development for me. [...] I used to hate html css. After getting my hands on kobweb I’m in love with it. 

> [!QUOTE]
> Finally got paid -- all thanks to kobweb 🎉💥 

> [!QUOTE]
> I didn't wanna learn any JS framework so when I first learned about kobweb it felt like a no-brainer; having built 2 Android apps with compose already and a backend with ktor. One could argue Android developers are the best target audience since the additional knowledge needed to move an app to the web with Kobweb is minimal. I love it! 🤩
