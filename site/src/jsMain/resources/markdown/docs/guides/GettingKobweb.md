title: Getting Kobweb
---

The first step is to get the Kobweb binary. You can install it, download it, and/or build it, so we'll include
instructions for all these approaches.

## Install the Kobweb binary

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

*OS: Mac and Linux*

```bash
$ brew install varabyte/tap/kobweb
```

### [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

*OS: Windows*

```shell
# Note: Adding buckets only has to be done once.

# Feel free to skip java if you already have it
> scoop bucket add java
> scoop install java/openjdk

# Install kobweb
> scoop bucket add varabyte https://github.com/varabyte/scoop-varabyte.git
> scoop install varabyte/kobweb
```

### [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

*OS: Windows, Mac, and \*nix*

```shell
$ sdk install kobweb
```

## Download the Kobweb binary

Our binary artifact is hosted on GitHub. To download latest, you can either
[grab the zip or tar file from the GitHub](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-cli/releases/tag/v0.9.12) or you can fetch
it from your terminal:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/applications

# You can either pull down the zip file

$ wget https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-cli/releases/download/v0.9.12/kobweb-0.9.12.zip
$ unzip kobweb-0.9.12.zip

# ... or the tar file

$ wget https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-cli/releases/download/v0.9.12/kobweb-0.9.12.tar
$ tar -xvf kobweb-0.9.12.tar
```

and I recommend adding it to your path, either directly:

```bash
$ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/applications/kobweb-0.9.12/bin
$ kobweb version # to check it's working
```

or via symbolic link:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/bin # some folder you've created that's in your PATH
$ ln -s /path/to/applications/kobweb-0.9.12/bin/kobweb kobweb
```

## Build the Kobweb binary

Although we host Kobweb artifacts on GitHub, it's easy enough to build your own.

Building Kobweb requires JDK11 or newer. We'll first discuss how to add it, but you can skip this step if you have
already done this on your machine.

### Download a JDK

If you want full control over your JDK install, manually downloading is a good option.

* [Download a JDK for your OS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)
* Unzip it somewhere
* Update your `JAVA_HOME` variable to point at it.

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdks/corretto-11.0.12
# ... or whatever version or path you chose
```

### Install a JDK with the IntelliJ IDE

For a more automated approach, you can request IntelliJ install a JDK for you.

Follow their instructions here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk

### Building the Kobweb CLI

The Kobweb CLI is actually maintained in a separate GitHub repo. Once you have the JDK set up, it should be easy to
clone and build it:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/src/root # some folder you've created for storing src code
$ git clone https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-cli
$ cd kobweb-cli
$ ./gradlew :kobweb:installDist
```

Finally, update your PATH:

```bash
$ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/src/root/kobweb-cli/kobweb/build/install/kobweb/bin
$ kobweb version # to check it's working
```

## Update the Kobweb binary

If you previously installed Kobweb and are aware that a new version is available, the way you update it depends on how
you installed it.
