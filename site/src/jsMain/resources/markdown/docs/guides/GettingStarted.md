Kobweb is an opinionated Kotlin framework for creating websites and web apps, built on top of
[Compose HTML](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#compose-html) and inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

```kotlin
@Page
@Composable
fun HomePage() {
  Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
    Row(Modifier.align(Alignment.End)) {
      var colorMode by rememberColorMode()
      Button(
        onClick = { colorMode = colorMode.opposite() },
        Modifier.borderRadius(50.percent).padding(0.px)
      ) {
        Box(Modifier.margin(7.px)) {
          // Includes support for Font Awesome icons
          if (colorMode.isLight()) FaSun() else FaMoon()
        }
      }
    }
    H1 {
      Text("Welcome to Kobweb!")
    }
    Row(Modifier.flexWrap(FlexWrap.Wrap)) {
      SpanText("Create rich, dynamic web apps with ease, leveraging ")
      Link("https://kotlinlang.org/", "Kotlin")
      SpanText(" and ")
      Link("https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#compose-html/", "Compose HTML")
    }
  }
}
```

Our goal is to provide:

* an intuitive structure for organizing your Kotlin website or web app
* automatic handling of routing between pages
* a collection of useful _batteries included_ widgets built on top of Compose HTML
* an environment built from the ground up around live reloading
* static site exports for improved SEO and potentially cheaper server setups
* support for responsive (i.e. mobile and desktop) design
* shared, rich types between client and server
* out-of-the-box Markdown support
* a way to easily define server API routes
* an open source foundation that the community can extend
* and much, much more!
