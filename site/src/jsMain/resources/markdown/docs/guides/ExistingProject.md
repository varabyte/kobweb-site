title: Adding Kobweb to an Existing Project
follows: CustomFonts
---

Currently, Kobweb is still under active development, and due to our limited resources, we are focusing on improving the
path to creating a new project from scratch. However, some users have shown interest in Kobweb but already have an
existing project and aren't sure how to add Kobweb into it.

As long as you understand that this path isn't officially supported yet, we'll provide steps below to take which may
help people accomplish this manually for now. Honestly, the hardest part is creating a correct `.kobweb/conf.yaml`,
which the following steps help you work around:

1. Be sure to check the Kobweb compatibility matrix [(COMPATIBILITY.md)](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md)
   to make sure you can match the versions it expects.
2. Create a dummy app project somewhere on your system. Pay attention to the questions it asks you, as you may want to
   choose a package name that matches your project.
   ```bash
   # In some tmp directory somewhere
   kobweb create app
   # or `kobweb create app/empty`, if you are already
   # experienced with Kobweb and know what you are doing
   ```
3. When finished, copy the `site` subfolder out into your own project. (Once done, you can delete the dummy project, as
   it has served its usefulness.)
   ```bash
   $ cp -r app/site /path/to/your/project
   # and then `rm -rf app`
   ```
4. Ensure your Gradle project is configured to include Maven Central and Gradle Plugin Portal repositories, as
   described in
   ${DocsLink("Kobweb artifact repositories", "/docs/getting-started/gradle-and-maven-artifacts#kobweb-artifact-repositories")}.
5. Kobweb uses ${DocsLink("Gradle version catalogs", "/docs/getting-started/gradle-and-maven-artifacts#gradle-version-catalogs")} 
   for its dependencies. Add or update your version catalog under `gradle/libs.versions.toml` to include these:
   ```toml
   [versions]
   jetbrains-compose = "..." # replace with actual version, see COMPATIBILITY.md!
   kobweb = "..." # replace with actual version
   kotlin = "..." # replace with actual version

   [libraries]
   kobweb-api = { module = "com.varabyte.kobweb:kobweb-api", version.ref = "kobweb" }
   kobweb-core = { module = "com.varabyte.kobweb:kobweb-core ", version.ref = "kobweb" }
   kobweb-silk = { module = "com.varabyte.kobweb:kobweb-silk", version.ref = "kobweb" }
   kobwebx-markdown = { module = "com.varabyte.kobwebx:kobwebx-markdown", version.ref = "kobweb" }
   silk-icons-fa = { module = "com.varabyte.kobwebx:silk-icons-fa", version.ref = "kobweb" }

   [plugins]
   jetbrains-compose = { id = "org.jetbrains.compose", version.ref = "jetbrains-compose" }
   kobweb-application = { id = "com.varabyte.kobweb.application", version.ref = "kobweb" }
   kobwebx-markdown = { id = "com.varabyte.kobwebx.markdown", version.ref = "kobweb" }
   kotlin-multiplatform = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform", version.ref = "kotlin" }
   ```

If everything is working as expected, you should be able to run Kobweb within your project now:

```bash
# In /path/to/your/project
cd site
kobweb run
```
