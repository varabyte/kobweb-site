#  HTML Styling

##  Inline vs StyleSheet

For those new to web dev, it's worth understanding that there are two ways to set styles on your HTML elements: inline
and stylesheet.

Inline styles are defined on the element tag itself. In raw HTML, this might look like:

```html
<div style="background-color:black">
```

Meanwhile, any given HTML page can reference a list of stylesheets which can define a bunch of styles, where each style
is tied to a selector (a rule which _selects_ what elements those styles apply to).

A concrete example of a very short stylesheet can help here:

```css
body {
  background-color: black;
  color: magenta
}
#title {
  color: yellow
}
```

And you could use that stylesheet to style the following document:

```html
<body>
  <!-- Title gets background-color from "body" and foreground color from "#title" -->
  <div id="title">Yellow on black</div>
  Magenta on black
</body>
```

> [!NOTE]
> When conflicting styles are present both in a stylesheet and as an inline declaration, the inline styles take
> precedence.

There's no hard and fast rule, but in general, when writing HTML / CSS by hand, stylesheets are often preferred over
inline styles as it better maintains a separation of concerns. That is, the HTML should represent the content of your
site, while the CSS controls the look and feel.

However! We're not writing HTML / CSS by hand. We're using Compose HTML! Should we even care about this in Kotlin?

As it turns out, there are times when you have to use stylesheets, because without them, you can't define styles for
advanced behaviors (particularly
[pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements),
and [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)). For example,
you can't override the color of visited links without using a stylesheet approach. So it's worth realizing there are
fundamental differences.

Finally, it can also be much easier debugging your page with browser tools when you lean on stylesheets over inline styles, as it
makes your DOM tree easier to read when your elements are simple (e.g. `<div class="title">`
vs. `<div style="color:yellow; background-color:black; font-size: 24px; ...">`).

We'll be introducing and discussing modifiers and CSS style blocks in more detail shortly. But in general, when you pass
modifiers directly into a composable widget in Silk, those will result in inline styles, whereas if you use a CSS
style block to define your styles, those will get embedded into the site's stylesheet:

```kotlin
// Uses inline styles
Box(Modifier.color(Colors.Red)) { /* ... */ }

// Uses a stylesheet
val BoxStyle = CssStyle {
    base { Modifier.Color(Colors.Red) }
}
Box(BoxStyle.toModifier()) { /* ... */ }
```

As a beginner, or even as an advanced user when prototyping, feel free to use inline modifiers as much as you can,
pivoting to CSS style blocks if you find yourself needing to use pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, or media queries. It
is fairly easy to migrate inline styles over to stylesheets in Kobweb.

In my own projects, I tend to use inline styles for really simple layout elements (e.g. `Row(Modifier.fillMaxWidth())`)
and CSS style blocks for complex and/or re-usable widgets. It actually becomes a nice organizational convention to have
all your styles grouped together in one place above the widget itself.

##  Modifier

Kobweb introduces the `Modifier` class, in order to provide an experience similar to what you find in Jetpack Compose.
(You can read [more about them here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/modifiers) if you're unfamiliar with
the concept).

In the world of Compose HTML, you can think of a `Modifier` as a wrapper on top of CSS styles and attributes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please refer to official documentation if you are not familiar with
> HTML [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes)
> and/or [styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style).

So this:

```kotlin
Modifier.backgroundColor(Colors.Red).color(Colors.Green).padding(200.px)
```

when passed into a widget provided by Kobweb, like `Box`:

```kotlin
Box(Modifier.backgroundColor(Colors.Red).color(Colors.Green).padding(200.px)) {
    /* ... */
}
```

would generate an HTML tag with a style property like: `<div style="background:red;color:green;padding:200px">`

###  attrsModifier and styleModifier

There are a bunch of modifier extensions (and they're growing) provided by Kobweb, like `background`, `color`, and
`padding` above. But there are also two escape hatches anytime you run into a modifier that's missing:
`attrsModifier` and `styleModifier`.

At this point, you are interacting with Compose HTML, one layer underneath Kobweb.

Using them looks like this:

```kotlin
// Modify attributes of an element tag
// e.g. the "a", "b", and "c" in <tag a="..." b="..." c="..." />
Modifier.attrsModifier {
    id("example")
}

// Modify styles of an element tag
// e.g. the "x", "y", and "z" in `<tag a="..." b="..." c="..." style="x:...;y:...;z:..." />
Modifier.styleModifier {
    width(100.percent)
    height(50.percent)
}

// Note: Because "style" itself is an attribute, you can define styles in an attrsModifier:
Modifier.attrsModifier {
    id("example")
    style {
        width(100.percent)
        height(50.percent)
    }
}
// ... but in the above case, you should use a styleModifier for simplicity
```

In the occasional (and hopefully rare!) case where Kobweb doesn't provide a modifier and Compose HTML doesn't provide
the attribute or style support you need, you can use `attrsModifier` plus the `attr` method or `styleModifier` plus the
`property` method. This escape hatch within an escape hatch allows you to provide any custom value you need.

The above cases can be rewritten as:

```kotlin
Modifier.attrsModifier {
    attr("id", "example")
}

Modifier.styleModifier {
    property("width", 100.percent)
    // Or even raw CSS:
    // property("width", "100%")
    property("height", 50.percent)
}
```

If you end up needing to use `attr` or `property` in your own codebase, consider
[filing an issue](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
with us so that we can add the missing modifier to the library.
